# Hi there, I'm Matěj Sojka! 👋

## About Me
I'm a passionate software enthusiast, deeply engaged with .NET and web application development. My love for coding stems from the joy of bringing my imagination to life through technology.

## Connect with Me
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mat%C4%9Bj-sojka-8056151b2/)
- 👀 I’m interested in .NET technologies and innovative web solutions.
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge in React and in tools, which allow me to create 3D websites.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects that challenge the status quo.

## My Work
- Check out my repositories to see what I've been up to!
- I'm particularly proud of Soicheek repository. It is a silly project I started at the end of 2023 to try Blazor with .NET 8, GitLab CI/CD (build, test, deploy), and Docker.
- I recently founded the company Mjays Software Solutions with which I push my side projects to the world and allows me to experiment with new technologies as a full-stack developer regularly.

## Let's Build Something Amazing Together
Got a super idea? Let's turn it into reality. Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations or just a chat about technology!
